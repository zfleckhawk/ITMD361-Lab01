    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I have been working with computers, programming, and general IT work from a very young age. I started by simply tearing apart computers from time to time, and then figuring out how to put them back together. Over time, that evolved into setting up computers to accomplish other tasks for me. Around 2011, I started my first web server with a website I made for my Minecraft server.. Yup, remember Minecraft? That was an awkward time.. I began to get into server hosting a bit more, and now I work with small businesses in my town to provide them with IT support and cloud hosting.
